## The Challenge

Rexona wanted to create an unforgettable World Cup campaign, blending physical and digital worlds to engage fans in a way that resonated with their love of soccer. The RoboKeeper—a robot goalkeeper equipped with computer vision capable of stopping the fastest shots—was the centerpiece of the campaign. However, not everyone could visit RoboKeeper in person, so we faced the challenge of bringing this exciting interaction to fans everywhere.

## The Solution

We launched Reto Rexona, a fully immersive online experience that allowed users to take penalty shots from the comfort of their homes. Using machine learning and Google’s TensorFlow AI technology, we tracked participants' body movements via their device cameras to determine the direction and intensity of their virtual shots.

## The Result

A gamified experience that simulated the challenge of facing RoboKeeper, complete with dynamic feedback and an engaging interface. Whether using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, fans could interact with the RoboKeeper in real time, creating an exciting and inclusive way to participate in the World Cup.
