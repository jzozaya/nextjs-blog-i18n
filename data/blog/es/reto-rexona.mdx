We enabled users to quick penalties from their living room with the use of computer vision.



Introducing Reto Rexona. During the 2022 FIFA World Cup, we invited everyone in Mexico to shoot a penalty against the best goalkeeper in the world, the RoboKeeper. A robot goalkeeper with computer vision that is capable of predicting the direction of the ball and stopping it at high speed, challenging even the best soccer players in the world. The whole country couldn't visit the RoboKeeper, so instead we took the RoboKeeper to the whole country.

We created an online experience where we gamified the training so that people could face the goalkeeper from any device, allowing them to take a virtual shot from anywhere as if they were directly in front of him. Using participants' own body movements and machine learning, together with Google's Tensorflow artificial intelligence technology, we could accurately identify and determine the direction and intensity of users' shots through their device.










### Lessons learned

Document as much as possible and embrace every project from a story telling perspective. Clients like to se 
continuos progress and they need to see that the project is taking shape in a way that makes sense to them.
It is common that influencers are going to be involved in the project, so it is important to have a clear vision of the project and be able to explain it in a simple way.
