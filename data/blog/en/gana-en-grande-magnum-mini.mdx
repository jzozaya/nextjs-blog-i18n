## Project Overview

Developed a mobile-first web application for Magnum, leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to enhance user engagement and drive product sales. The app allowed users to sign up using their email and password, and then upload photos of their purchase receipts. This enabled them to participate in an interactive game where they could earn points redeemable for exciting prizes, including gift cards and a trip to France. This campaign was a strategic collaboration between Walmart and Unilever to promote the launch of a new product line, Magnum Mini.


## Key Features

+ User Authentication: Secure sign-up and login using email and password.

+ Receipt Submission: Users could upload photos of their purchase receipts.

+ OCR Integration: Implemented an OCR algorithm to extract and validate purchase information from the receipts.

+ Interactive Game: Users earned points by participating in the game, which could be redeemed for prizes.

+ Prize Redemption: Points could be used to enter a draw for a trip to Europe or redeem gift cards.


## Technologies and Skills

+ Frontend: Developed using Next.js for a responsive, mobile-first experience.

+ Backend: Utilized Node.js for server-side logic and API integrations.

+ Computer Vision: Integrated OCR algorithms for accurate receipt data extraction.

+ Cloud Storage: Used Cloudinary for efficient image upload and management.

+ User Experience: Focused on creating an engaging and seamless user journey to encourage participation and repeat usage.


## Impact
