## Project Overview

Developed a mobile-first web application for Magnum, leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to enhance user engagement and drive product sales. The app allowed users to sign up using their email and password, and then upload photos of their purchase receipts. This enabled them to participate in an interactive game where they could earn points redeemable for exciting prizes, including gift cards and a trip to France. This campaign was a strategic collaboration between Walmart and Unilever to promote the launch of a new product line, Magnum Mini.
