summary: This online store was launched a few years ago as part of a digital transformation strategy where my clients aimed to harness technology to its fullest potential. At that time, Headless e-commerce was just beginning to take off, positioning us at the forefront of digital innovation.

Almost every piece of content is manageable by my client. His dashboard is set up in a way that he can easily create/add/remove content without asking me for help. By creating a set of components "like puzzle pieces", content editors will be able to quickly build new pages without the need for a developer. Sanity's simple learning curve makes it my top solution for sites where the owner wants to do content management but doesn't want to know anything about building or maintaining a complex e-commerce website.

Plase take a look at the editorial experience. It's when you have an editorial team that are working simultaneously on different articles, and they need to see how the article will look like in the website.

How is that a headless solution beats a traditional shopify theme built with liquid?
