## The Challenge

Rexona wanted to create an unforgettable World Cup campaign, blending physical and digital worlds to engage fans in a way that resonated with their love of soccer. The RoboKeeper—a robot goalkeeper equipped with computer vision capable of stopping the fastest shots—was the centerpiece of the campaign. However, not everyone could visit RoboKeeper in person, so we faced the challenge of bringing this exciting interaction to fans everywhere.

## The Solution

We launched Reto Rexona, an immersive online experience that let users take penalty shots right from their homes. Leveraging machine learning and a pre-trained model from Google’s TensorFlow suite, we used device cameras to track participants' body movements, accurately determining the direction and intensity of their virtual shots.

## The Result

A gamified experience that simulated the challenge of facing RoboKeeper, complete with dynamic feedback and an engaging interface. Whether using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, fans could interact with the RoboKeeper in real time, creating an exciting and inclusive way to participate in the World Cup.

The campaign brought the magic of the World Cup into the homes of hundreds of thousands of fans, solidifying Rexona’s reputation as an innovative and forward-thinking brand. It also demonstrated the power of combining sports, technology, and storytelling to create meaningful digital experiences.

## Lessons Learned

+ Document the project’s evolution: Storytelling is key to success. As you test hypotheses and functionalities, record clips of the process, even if they’re rough. This not only makes it easier to demonstrate how things work and the intent behind each step but also helps build a narrative that generates excitement and trust. Clients appreciate seeing continuous progress and a clear story that reflects the project’s development in an engaging and professional way.

+ Test before you develop: Before diving into detailed coding for a specific feature, create small prototypes to test whether the main components align with the overall vision under various scenarios, such as different internet speeds or low-end devices. As developers, we typically have access to high-speed internet and powerful devices, but the users we aim to serve often face entirely different conditions, and we must design with their realities in mind.

+ Involve influencers early: When influencers are part of a campaign, it’s crucial to integrate them in the early stages so they can fully understand the project’s goals and purpose. Early involvement not only helps align their communication with the strategy but also provides them the opportunity to bring creative and authentic ideas that resonate with their audiences, ultimately enhancing the campaign’s impact in a meaningful way.
